Recruiter: Von Neumann Standing Compiler
========================================

[Von Neumann Standing](https://github.com/Labdabeta/vns) is a programming/AI
game that uses a custom assembly language. Recruiter is an compiler/assember
for that language.

It is incomplete and not useable at this time, use the *as* compiler packaged
with the game for now. Notes about installing and using recruiter will be
provided once there is a point to doing those things.

Implemenations
--------------

There are several planned implementations of Recuriter for various purposes.

### Python ###

I'm really busy right now so while I'm exploring the design of this program
it will be written in Python. This is a proto-type implementation that wraps
the *as* compiler.

### C++ ###

C++ is my best programming language, so the main implementation will probably
be in that. This will fully replace the *as* compiler, replicating all the
features provided, although not always with the same usage.

### Ada ###

Some day an Ada implementation, built to the same standards as the game
itself, might be created. However this is far off.
